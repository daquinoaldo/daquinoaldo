# Hi, I'm [Aldo D'Aquino!](https://ald.ooo/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile_repo&utm_term=title) 👋

🧑‍💻 I'm a software engineering lead at [@BendingSpoons](https://github.com/BendingSpoons).\
🙌 I'm positive-minded by nature. I adapt to situations. I like new challenges. I learn fast.\
💡 I'm extremely curious. I love experiment with new technologies, learn new things, and try new programming languages.\
💬 I communicate a lot. I foster dialogue and give honest feedback. Coaching people is a core part of my job.\
🌎 I live in Tuscany, close to the sea. This is one of the benefits of fully-remote work, which is non-negotiable.\
🤹 I'm a public speaker and open-source developer. I love meeting new people and exchange ideas.
